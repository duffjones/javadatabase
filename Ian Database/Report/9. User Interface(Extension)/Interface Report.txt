Unfortunately, due to time restraints, I wasn't able to finish a decent user interface. I did make some attempts, and have created a basic system that allows users to:

-create a table
-create a row
-target a table by name
-add a row to a table

TODO
----
-remove a row from a table. 
-update a row from a table. 
-lookup a key
-search for content
-etc

My first attempt was with using a simple Case/Switch. The users read a menu, and can select functions with the number keys. These cases then prompt the user for necesary data, and create objects with that data. It works well, but nexting these complex methods in a Case causes issues -- primarily: what table am I targetting, what database are these tables in, are the changes I make persistant? With everything in a single function with a switch, to run the switch again creates new objects, with new values and keys. I need a persistant database that can be accessed and changed -- I DONT need to create a new version with every use. 

If I had time to continue I would separate out methods for each method in my other classes, and allow the user to fill their arguments with an input after prompting.
