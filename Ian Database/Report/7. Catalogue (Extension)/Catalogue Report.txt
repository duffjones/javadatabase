My first idea for experimenting with catalogues was to print the headers for each table stored in a database. This was pretty easy, as I just had to iterate through my ArrayList<Database> for Database.size times -- then print the first row stored in each of those tables. 

Moving forward, I wanted to be able to print out a list of tables, which would mean adding a "Table Name" value to my Table Object. This could then be printed in Database, similar to above. 

Since not every table has/needs a title I added a third constructor that takes a string argument for table title. If a user enters a name, it will be populated, otherwise the value will remain null...After implementing this, it seems easier to always have a title, so the user is now required to enter one when constructing a table. 

Once tables all had titles, I decided to implement a database feature to search and return a table based on its title. Doing this was pretty simple, involved iterating through each database ArrayList<Table> element, and checking if its title matched a string argument. If it did, it returns the table with the title. Otherwise it returns NULL. 

Specific selection of rows, or fields can be done with methods in the respective classes. 

Code: 

	//prints all table headers stored in database. 
	void getTableHeaders() {
		for (int i = 0; i < tablearray.size(); i++) {
			Table value = tablearray.get(i);
			Row valuerow = value.getTable().get(0);
			System.out.println("Table " + (i+1) + ":");
			valuerow.rowPrint();
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
	
	//prints all table titles
	void getTableTitles() {
		for (int i = 0; i < tablearray.size(); i++) {
			Table value = tablearray.get(i);
			String title = value.tabletitle(); 
			System.out.println("Table " + (i+1) + " Title:   " + tle);
		}
	}
	
	//select a table in database by title, return it; 
	Table selectTableByTitle(String title) {
		for (int i = 0; i < tablearray.size(); i++) {
			Table value = tablearray.get(i);
			if(value.tabletitle().contains(title)) {
				System.out.println("Table with Title:   <<" + title + ">>   found.");
				return value; 	
			}}
		System.out.println("No Table with that Title found");
		return null; 
	}
