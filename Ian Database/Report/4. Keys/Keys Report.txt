I considered several options for implementing keys: 

-Storing a key in the Record/Row object, and accessing it from Tables. 
-Refactoring to a Hashmap and using the keys for that. 
-Storing key in an ArrayList<Integer> in tables. 

Honestly, I just went with what was simplest to implement which is the third option. 

Whenever I add a row to a table, I save its fielddata to an ArrayList<String>. I just added a function to randomly generate a key, stored in Row.Class, whenever a Row is created. Then, I created a second ArrayList<Integer> in table, that stores the value from Row.Key() each time a new row is stored in the table. 

element[i] in ArrayList<String>, which correspongs with a row/record can be paired with its key element[i] in ArrayList<Integer>. 

If I search ArrayList<Integer> for a key, I can return its element number, and simply search for that corresponding element in my array of Rows. 

-Current issue with that is that the key is not saved to a file when I serialize. I will need to refactor my print function to save keys. This also makes me realize that I might create a second way to store files with my print function that will make them readable in English. 

-Eventually I changes Row to be an object that can be stored in Table, rather than just a String[]. This allowed me to store keys both in the Row and in the Table. Now I can check if a key exists when I'm creating a Row() in Table(), while also preserving the keys, not generating new ones, when I serialize my objects. 



KeyGen code: 

	String genRandom() {
		int rando = new Random().nextInt(1000000) + 999999;
		String randomstr = "KEY-";
		randomstr = randomstr + Integer.toString(rando);
		return randomstr;
	}

Handling of duplicate keys is done in Table.class, when a new row is added, a table is checked for matching keys, and the Row is rebuilt if one exists: 

			
	if(keydata.contains(firstrow.key())) {
		Row newrowkey = new Row(firstrow.field());
		firstrow = newrowkey; 
	}
