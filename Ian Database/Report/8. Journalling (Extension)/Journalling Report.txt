Time is short, so I am going to attempt a very simple form of journaling. In a loop I can check if any changes have been made to a database, every 30 seconds or so. If changes have been made, the database will be saved/serialized to a journal file under a unique name that includes the timestamp of when the database was saved. 

At the very least this will allow a user to go back and find older versions of their database, in case of a crash or other problems. 

After that, I would possibly like to implement a feature that deletes very old records, so the file doesn't become too large.
